# Intro-to-Java
<b>May 24, 2020</b><br>
Contained within this repo is a sample project I followed along with from a walkthrough to grow and develope my knowledge of Java (which at this current momment is none). As I go through this walkthrough I will make frequent commits that will explain the work I've done, and within this README I will document (for my own practice and for notes) what I have done in this project.<br>

Installed Eclipse IDE and Java JDK, once configured simply created a new project in Eclipse and then printed to the console "Hello World!".<br>
System.out: The `Output Stream`; appears in the console<br>
System.out.println(): used to print to the console<br>

Spent lots of time understanding the basics and the syntaxing of Java. My code contains all of my notes but to sum up the brunt of the work done:<br>
- Classes: named, have an access modifier (declares the accessibility of the class), contents within them are their members
- Methods: declared within classes, every program MUST have a method named 'main'
- Parameters: placeholder names that are within the parentheses of a method
- Arguments: the actual value being passed into a function within it's parentheses
- Structure of an Object: Type identifier = new Type()
- import: used to import packages into the code > import java.XXXX.XXXX;
- Error types:
  - runtime errors: able to run the program but crashes
  - compile errors: allows you to fix the error before it runs<br>

  Practice work with different data types:
  - Primtive: booleans, bytes, char, short, long, int, float, double
  - Objects: instances of a class data type
  Learned about type literals where the value is just expressed without the 'new' keyword. Also that Java is a staically typed language which means all types for the data being used needs to be declared first.<br>
  Practice with user input via the Scanner class, assigning methods like nextLine() to a variable so that what gets inputed by the user is stored in a variable. Many different types of reading methods that Scanner allows us to use (for each primitive data type and more).<br>
