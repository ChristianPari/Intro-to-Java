# Intro-to-Java
<b>May 24, 2020</b><br>
Contained within this repo is a sample project I followed along with from a walkthrough to grow and develope my knowledge of Java (which at this current momment is none). As I go through this walkthrough I will make frequent commits that will explain the work I've done, and within this README I will document (for my own practice and for notes) what I have done in this project.
